# Color Detection from Images

This application allows users to upload an image, click on any point, and instantly get the color name and RGB values of that pixel.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.x:** (Recommended 3.8 or higher) You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **pip:** Python's package installer (usually comes with Python)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit opencv-python pandas
    ```

## Dataset

* Ensure you have the `colors.csv` file in the same directory as your main script. This file should contain the color names and their corresponding RGB values.

## Running the Application

1.  **Run the Streamlit app:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run your_app_name.py
    ```

    (Replace `your_app_name.py` with the actual name of your main Python script)

2.  **Open the application in your browser:**

    Streamlit will automatically open a new tab in your default web browser. If it doesn't, it will provide you with a local URL to access the app.

## Usage

1.  **Upload Image:** Use the file uploader to upload the image you want to analyze.
2.  **Click on the Image:** Click on any point in the displayed image.
3.  **View Color Information:** The application will display the closest matching color name, the RGB values of the selected pixel, and a color swatch.
